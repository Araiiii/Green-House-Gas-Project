        <div class="d0"> <u>FISH</u> <br><img src="https://media.istockphoto.com/vectors/print-vector-id899312742?k=6&m=899312742&s=612x612&w=0&h=q-BmUdt0WOeRq6r3aHEBEFqT2QJWWRaNIDkbpsoVjMs="> <br>Before considering how sea creatures are negatively impacted, first one must consider their home; the sea. With rising levels of gases, the largest being carbon dioxide from human activity,causes sea temperatures to increase, deoxygenating the sea at different depths. Not only does marine life become contaminated and endangered physically, it also disrupts/terminates organisms with fertility as embryos, larvae, and fish eggs are often more vulnerable to environmental stress as a result of being susceptible to low water pH. pH levels that do not fall in the “safe range”entails signs of chemical or heavy metal pollution. Emissions of carbon dioxide happens EVERYWHERE, but most largely in China as they are the backbone of fisheries. As machinery and catching methods cause absurd amounts of CO2 gases to increase in oceans and seas everywhere, the amount of moles increases which then causes the pressure to decrease; this is known as boyle's law. In the end, as this is happening and will continue to occur per Boyle's law, relatively low-pressure environment, the gases inside sea creatures' bodies will expand, and they will immediately collapse adding on to the debris and pollution in the water.</div>
        <div class="d1"><u> PLANTS & FUNGI</u> <br> <img src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2012/07/Dead-crops-e1343317018369.jpg"> <br>The emissions of gases on plants and fungi heavily influences climate (floods, droughts, & heat), agriculture, and even stomata. The carbon dioxide enters the leaves of the plant through small pores known as the stomata. During this process, the plants combine this gas with water to allow ‘their bodies’ to extract what it needs for food and also to release oxygen- also known as photosynthesis. Carbon dioxide is essential to plants to follow through with their photosynthesis process, but when the CO2 supply is exhausted or too much, the plants will stop growing and potentially die out. Due to the fact that carbon dioxide absorbs and radiates heat, heat then prompts droughts hindering agriculture. With drought, soil is not being watered- ceasing access to [essential food] resources for humans and crops themselves as they are unable to grow. As this continues, climate change and uncontrollable weather occurances will be the 'new normal'. Same with floods; when plants/soil have intolerable amounts of water, they will drown- resulting in the plant being in vain. This happens all around the world especially in farming areas and areas most susceptible to drier conditions (e.i. Deserts & many Asia & Africa countries, etc). This particular phenomena falls under boyle’s law as this law states that the volume of a sample of gas is, at a constant temperature, inversely proportional to the pressure of that gas- This can reference the photosynthesis process. </div>
        <div class="d2"> <u>MAMMALS</u> <br> <img src="https://savepolarbears.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/35/2018/08/171214-vide-starving-polar-bear-01-1100x734.jpg"><br>Greenhouse gases affect mammals in many different ways as it affects their natural habitats, evolutionary practices, and food supply. Many animal instincts are based upon temperature and temperature changes, which ultimately influences animal behaviours such as mating and hibernation. For example, for bears, once the temperature starts to drop as winter approaches, they are aware that it is time to hibernate. Although, because greenhouse gases increase the temperature, this animal instinct is disturbed and causes bears to hibernate later than usual. Regarding habitats, when temperatures rise it causes ice to melt and animals like polar bears lose their homes in the Arctic. Increased CO2 raises temperature and as a result pressure is increased as well, according to Gay-Lussac’s law. This causes coastal animals to try to move inland where they would have to eventually compete for a new habitat and food. If continued, more animals would have to compete for food, which is becoming scarce due to acid rain heightened by trapped greenhouse gases.. Survival of the animal species is gradually becoming threatened.

        <div class="d3"> <u>BIRDS</u> <br><img src="https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/China-climate-pledge-e1601033452994.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1600&h=900&crop=1"><br> Birds today face a number of threats when greenhouse gases are released. One major disturbance faced by birds is that regarding their phenology(timing of natural events)/migration. Because temperature is the main determining factor of migration, when the temperature is altered it can affect when they migrate and complicate the entire process. A species of birds in Europe called Parus major use temperature to help schedule reproduction/mating, which also relies on prey abundance. Usually these birds breed in the spring, but since temperatures have increased rapidly, their prey (caterpillars) have been emerging earlier and the birds lay their eggs later than they should. These birds become at risk to a decrease in reproduction output due to late mating and early prey availability. This is just one of many examples of birds that are affected by greenhouse emissions, in fact, about half of the species are facing extinction at this moment. One solution that could most likely reverse this outcome is creating artificial nests, in order to help preserve their habitats and eventually reproduction rates. </div>
        <div class="d4"> <u>What is something(s) WE can easily do to reduce/reverse this particular trend of gas emissions ?</u> <br> <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQfhPLTRjWmpuZFgRX08Eenvlsj6TWlpwFyvw&usqp=CAU"><br>Some realistic tasks that we can do daily to reduce or start to reverse the ‘trend’ of gas emissions are the following:


            <ul class="unordered">
                <li> Turn off the light when exiting a room</li>
                <li> Have a plant based diet once in a while </li>
                <li> Reduce, reuse and recycle </li>
                <li> Alternate riding a bike or skating instead of driving</li>
                <li>Turn your thermostat down by 3 degrees</li>
                <li>Spread the word; encourage a friend to do the things listed above </li>
            </ul>
